# Regression Datasets & Analysis

This repository contains the implementation of a custom **Decision Tree Regressor** and **Random Forrest Regressor**  built from scratch in Python. Below are the details for the datasets used to benchmark the model.

## 1. Student Performance
Predicts a student's performance index based on study hours, sleep, and previous scores. This dataset is ideal for testing simple linear relationships.

* **Source:** [Kaggle - Student Performance (Multiple Linear Regression)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil7280/student-performance-multiple-linear-regression/data)
* **Target Variable (`y`):** `Performance Index`
* **Key Features:** add

## 2. Cancer Data
Epidemiological data used to predict cancer mortality rates or incidence based on population demographics. 

* **Source:** [Kaggle - Cancer Regression](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varunraskar/cancer-regression/data)
* **Target Variable (`y`):** `target_deathrate` 
* **Key Features:** add

## 3. Possum Measurements
Physical measurements of possums caught in Australia. This dataset is excellent for biological regression tasks and handling mixed categorical/numerical data.

* **Source:** [Kaggle - OpenIntro Possum](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abrambeyer/openintro-possum)
* **Target Variable (`y`):** `footlgth`
* **Key Features:** add
